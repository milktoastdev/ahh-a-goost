// Naming Conventions

/*
	* Hello Goost Team!
	* For your reference and for our ongoing clarity, this document contains all naming conventions to be used within the Unity project.
	* Naming conventions are essential to efficient and readable code.
	* Our names following a clear convention will make programming a lot easier for everyone, especially when working on the same scripts.
	* If you have any questions or suggestions, please Slack me or DM me on Discord :)

// I will refer to cases a lot: 
	// PascalCase (First letter of each word is capitalised)
	// camelCase (First letter of every word after the first is capitalised)

// Namespaces, Classes & Methods | PascalCase
	// * A collection of classes that are referred to using a prefix on the class name

	public class ThisIsANamespace : MonoBehaviour
	{
		AnotherExample.CurrentGame.UI.MainMenu;

		public void SomeMethod{}
	}

// Fields are camelCase, Static Fields are PascalCase

	// Field
	private int thisIsAField;
	private static int ThisIsAStaticField;

// Parameters | camelCase

	public void ExampleFunction(int exampleParameter);

// Events & Actions have the "On" prefix | PascalCase

	public UnityAction OnDeath;
