// Naming Conventions

/*
	* Hello Goost Team!
	* For your reference and for our ongoing clarity, this document contains all naming conventions to be used within the Unity project.
	* Naming conventions are essential to efficient and readable code.
	* Our names following a clear convention will make programming a lot easier for everyone, especially when working on the same scripts.
	* If you have any questions or suggestions, please Slack me or DM me on Discord :)
